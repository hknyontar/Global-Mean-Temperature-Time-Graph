Global warming isn’t a blanket that heats every spot evenly. One region can warm by several degrees while another cools slightly in the same decade. 
The key—and a clue to both risks and solutions—is the climate system’s thermal inertia. Because oceans and soils can store vast amounts of heat, there’s always a delay between an energy imbalance and the atmosphere’s full response. 
Even if emissions stopped today, temperatures would keep climbing until the system settles at a new equilibrium; if we keep emitting, that equilibrium point drifts ever higher.
Thermal inertia also makes warming asymmetrical between day and night: nights warm faster than days, quietly pushing up the daily mean. Grasping these built-in lags helps us read the temperature charts—and underlines why rapid emissions cuts matter.
